# Delsys Acquisition Interface

This is a simple Visual C# program written for acquisition of Delsys Trigno sensors based on the SDK C# examples. The program depends on the Trigno Control Utility Server (https://delsys.com/downloads/INSTALLER/trignosdkserver_3-5-9.exe). A simple visual interface is also available to verify data integrity. 

The data storage is based on a customizable unencrypted binary writer. Data will be stored in the same folder as the executable.
